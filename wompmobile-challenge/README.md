## Goal

Create a movie search engine using the OMBd API and AMP components.

## Specifications

Your design should target mobile devices, and there is no need to create responsive breakpoints for desktop browsers. The final solution can be as simple or complex as you'd like so long as the basic requirements listed below are met.

## Resources

The AMP Documentation is a great resource.

In addition to any of the "getting started" tutorials, we recommend reviewing amp-list, amp-img, amp-bind, AMP Actions & Events.

## Requirements

- [x] Provide your solution as a single HTML file that passes the AMP Validator.
- [x] Include a text input that refreshes the dynamic content as the user types.
- [x] Include an amp-list, amp-img, and demonstrate usage of amp-bind and event handling.
- [x] At a minimum, display the movie title and cover image.
- [x] Apply some basic CSS to the page.

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] For each movie, create an expanding details section that makes an additional API call to fetch more information using the imdbID parameter.
- [ ] Flush out the styles & DOM to feel like a real web page (i.e. header, sidebar, etc).
- [ ] Show a total result count.
- [ ] Add pagination.
- [x] Add a fallback for posters that aren't available.
- [ ] Add persistence.
